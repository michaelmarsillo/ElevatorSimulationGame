# ElevatorSimulationGame

## Introduction
One day, I was riding in the elevator of my apartment and thought, this elevator system could be replicated by a simple Python project. That spark of curiosity led me to try and replicate an elevator system using Python, applying my current coding knowledge to make a small simulation. This project introduces core programming concepts like conditional statements, loops, lists, and functions while simulating an interactive elevator experience.

## Features
• Multiple Floor Selection: Navigate between floors by entering the target floor number.

• Passenger Weight Management: Adds and removes passengers based on their weight, ensuring the total weight doesn’t exceed the elevator's capacity.

• Passenger Count Limit: Limits the number of passengers, ensuring the elevator doesn't exceed its max capacity.

• Floor-by-Floor Simulation: Displays each floor passed in real-time, simulating elevator movement.

• Passenger On/Off Control: Prompts passengers to get on or off at each floor, adjusting the total weight accordingly.

## How it Works 
1. The elevator starts at a default floor (Floor 1)
   
3. Users can add passengers with specified weights until the max weight or capacity is reached.
   
5. The user selects the target floor, and the elevator “moves” floor-by-floor, displaying each floor as it’s passed.
   
7. When the elevator reaches a floor, it asks if passengers want to get off or if new passengers want to get on, adjusting the total weight and count each time.
   
9. The program exits if a passenger requests floor “0.”

## Future Enhancements 
• Adding a GUI for a more interactive experience.
